## what is it?

leaflet is a Fabric modpack created as a way to implement a modded experience while also being friendly towards a player's FPS.

This modpack uses mods from both CurseForge and Modrinth and merges them together using [packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz).

## what mods are included?
A list of all mods/libraries used in this modpack is available [here](MODS.md).

## faq:

### can i request a mod?
Yes! I would love to add more mods that are compatible and fit within the style of this modpack!

### will this modpack ever be published on Modrinth?
While I would like to publish this modpack on the platform, restrictions with mod licenses prevent me from doing so.
That being said, the Modrinth pack is available for download in all releases.
